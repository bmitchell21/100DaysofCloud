## Introduction

Hi! Welcome to day 1. I'm choosing to create a chatbot because chatbots help to better a customer's experience.

## Prerequisite

So far... you need to know a little JavaScript. Hooray, right? The templates given by Kommunicate don't work without some tweaking, my friends.


## Cloud Research

No screenshots this go-round. Anyway. I didn't even get to do much work in the cloud today. I wrote the script for my chat bot.

## Try yourself

I don't have a detailed tutorial for this specific step as my code will be on display. View this [https://docs.kommunicate.io/docs/web-installation](Kommunicate) installation tutorial for first steps. I used ReactJS :)


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I learned... about Kommunicate! A cool tool the connects with Amazon Lex so devs can add chatbots to websites. Yessir.

## Next Steps

Next... I want to integrate the bot with Lex :)

## Social Proof

No capping here.
